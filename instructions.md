Sure! Let's create a table that outlines the features, input, output, error messages, and test scenarios for each endpoint of the Todo List API project:

| Endpoint               | Feature                   | Input                      | Output                              | Error Messages                                           | Test Scenarios                                                                                                                  |

| GET /api/tasks         | Get all tasks             | None                       | Array of task objects              | - Error fetching tasks                                  | - Ensure the API returns an array of tasks                                                                                       |
| GET /api/tasks/:id     | Get a specific task by ID | Task ID as a route parameter | Task object                        | - Task not found                                       | - Ensure the API returns the correct task for a valid ID                                                                         |
| PUT /api/tasks/:id     | Update a task             | Task ID as a route parameter, { "title": string, "description": string, "completed": boolean } | Updated task object                 | - Task not found<br>- Invalid or missing title/description | - Send a valid request with title/description and ensure the API updates the task                                               |
| DELETE /api/tasks/:id  | Delete a task             | Task ID as a route parameter | { "message": string }               | - Task not found                                       | - Ensure the API deletes the correct task for a valid ID                                                                        |
| PUT /api/tasks/:id/complete | Mark task as completed | Task ID as a route parameter | Updated task object with completed set to true | - Task not found                                    | - Ensure the API marks the correct task as completed for a valid ID                                                            |

For testing, you can use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha and libraries like Supertest to simulate API requests. Here are some test scenarios for the Todo List API:

1. Test Scenario: Creating a New Task
   - Send a POST request to `/api/tasks` with a valid JSON payload containing title and description.
   - Ensure the response status code is 201 (Created).
   - Verify that the returned task object includes the correct title, description, and an autogenerated task ID.

2. Test Scenario: Getting All Tasks
   - Send a GET request to `/api/tasks`.
   - Ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
   - Validate that the response is an array of task objects.

3. Test Scenario: Getting a Specific Task by ID
   - Send a GET request to `/api/tasks/:id` with a valid task ID.
   - Ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
   - Verify that the returned task object matches the task with the specified ID.

4. Test Scenario: Updating a Task
   - Send a PUT request to `/api/tasks/:id` with a valid task ID and a JSON payload containing updated title and description.
   - Ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
   - Verify that the returned task object reflects the updated title and description.

5. Test Scenario: Deleting a Task
   - Send a DELETE request to `/api/tasks/:id` with a valid task ID.
   - Ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
   - Verify that the response message confirms the successful deletion of the task.

6. Test Scenario: Marking a Task as Completed
   - Send a PUT request to `/api/tasks/:id/complete` with a valid task ID.
   - Ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
   - Verify that the returned task object shows the completed status as true.

These test scenarios cover different API endpoints and various scenarios to ensure that the Todo List API functions correctly and handles errors gracefully. You can further extend the test coverage by adding edge cases and additional error scenarios to make your API robust and reliable.
